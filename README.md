# Webinar Series for Open Source Software & Algorithm developer's in the physical behaviour research field

We are a group of Open Source Software developers in the physical behaviour research field who meet up once per month. 
We use this repository to keep a record of past and upcoming meetings and collect ideas for webinar topics.

**The webinar series aims to:**

- Provide a platform for research software/algorithm developers to meet each other.
- Support each other in research software development challenges.
- Raise awareness and understanding of each other’s work
- Work towards improved Open Source Software (OSS) re-use, compatibility, and quality in the field.
- Advocate OSS in the physical behaviour research community.
- Be open to any programming expertise level.
- Open to any programming languague/technology (R, Python, Matlab, ...)
- One webinar per month, typically 1 hour, format flexible, e.g. lecture, discussion, tutorial.

**New group members welcome!**

We currently have a steady group of around 10-15 participants from across the U.S., Europe and New Zealand.
If you are also an Open Source Software Developer and would like to join us then please send us an e-mail: v.vanhees [at] accelting.com or tom.stewart [at] aut.ac.nz.

## Rules of conduct:
- If you do not make your (main) code Open Source, then we would rather not have you in this group.
- Bad software or algorithms do not exist in this group. Feedback should always be constructive, and nobody should feel afraid to present their work.
- Everything discussed in this group is not confidential, unless the presenter explicitly asks for confidentiality.
- We adhere to the Open Source license definitions, where code that comes with an open source license can be used by others as specified by the license.
